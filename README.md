# ug-pedal

## Overview

This project uses an Adafruit nRF52840 Express to act as a foot pedal to control the Ultimate Guitar app on iOS (Android not tested).

The sketch currently maps the following keys to the "pedals" that are recognized by Ultimate Guitar:

- HID_KEY_4 => Ped0
- HID_KEY_BACKSLASH => Ped1
- HID_KEY_PERIOD => Ped2
- HID_KEY_SEMICOLON => Ped3
- HID_KEY_SLASH => Ped4
- HID_KEY_GRAVE => Ped5
- HID_KEY_COMMA => Ped6
